check it out ! Most will be Linux things, be don't be afraid of Linux, he just

if you have never used any GNU/Linux operating system. You can install it alongside
windows of iOS or even on a USB key ! Contact me if you need help ;)

With no order :
 - [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org) : a tiling window manager that take some time to get
	 used to, but will transform the way you use your computer. Caution : once you
	 use it, you wont be able to use any non-tiling window manager.
	 (*tiling window manager* : it places your windows automatically
	 to take the maximum space).
 - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) : web browser that
	is fast, secure, synchronised and cares about you and not your data.
 - Clion, Pycharm : Code editor by [jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), very efficient IDEs for any language.
